    <h1 id="l1">When in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes</h1>
    <h1 id="l2">I all alone beweep my outcast state,</h1>
    <h1 id="l3">And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,</h1>
    <h1 id="l4">And look upon myself, and curse my fate,</h1>
    <h1 id="l5">Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</h>
    <h1 id="l6">Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,</h1>
    <h1 id="l7">Desiring this man’s art, and that man’s scope,</h1>
    <h1 id="l8">With what I most enjoy contented least;</h1>
    <h1 id="l9">Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising,</h1>
    <h1 id="l10">Haply I think on thee, and then my state,</h1>
    <h1 id="l11">Like to the lark at break of day arising</h1>
    <h1 id="l12">From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven’s gate;</h1>
    <h1 id="l13">For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings</h1>
    <h1 id="l14">That then I scorn to change my state with kings.</h1>
